# Global Immunological Course -Day-4

## Day -4:

### Session 1: Siddharth Jhunjunwala - Blood Cells

- **Cellular Components:**
  - RBC: Carry hemoglobin
  - WBC
  - Platelets

- **Non-Cellular Components:**
  - Proteins
  - Water
  - Lipids, Sugars

- **Motion of Heart:** 
  - Discontinuous pump â†’ Continuous blood flow
  - Blood is a non-Newtonian fluid, flowing close to laminar.
  - Non-cellular fluids flow at the periphery in laminar flow.
  
- **Interaction with Endothelial Cells:**
  - Receptor activation: adhesion/binding, vasodilation.
  - Activation due to complement molecules and ATP signaling.
  - Receptor activation leads to vasodilation and allows for rolling and arrest of WBCs.
  
### WBCs in Circulation:
- Neutrophils: First to adhere to endothelial cells (40-70% in humans).
- Basophils and eosinophils also potentially adhere.
- Monocytes and lymphocytes present.
  
### Division of Labour in Immune Cells:
- Likely related to mammalian lifespans influencing cell lifespans.
- Immune cell counts alter in various diseases; CBC is the first test ordered.

### Neutrophils:
- Play a major role in inflammation and response to cues.
- Path to the site of inflammation created by degrading extracellular matrix proteins.
- Sequence of events: inflammation, tissue resident immune cell activation, chemical signals, receptor activation, vasodilation, neutrophil rolling, arrest, and extravasation.

### Platelets & Inflammation:
- Platelets clot blood vessels, producing prostaglandins and 5HT.
- Basophils prevent clotting with heparin to allow immune cell access.
- Stable state reached quickly, allowing platelets to dominate.

### Neutrophil Functions:
- Secretion of degradative enzymes, oxidative processes, and phagocytosis.
- NETosis: Neutrophil Extracellular Trap - a unique neutrophil death process.
  
### Regulation of Neutrophil Activities:
- Degradative enzyme regulation, short neutrophil lifespan (2-3 days), macrophage clearance.
- DNAses and macrophages clear NETs, regulating inflammation.

### Other Immune Cells:
- Eosinophils, basophils, and mast cells respond to pathogens, associated with allergies.
- Mast cells found in lungs may indicate asthma.

### Session 2: Paper Discussion
- Functional Role of Type I and Type II Interferons in Antiviral Defense.
- Goal of the experiment: "To be written..."
