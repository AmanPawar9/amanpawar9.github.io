# Global Immunology Course -Day-8

## Session 1: Prof. Anjali

### B-Cells

- **Unique Function of B-Cells:**
  - Synthesis of immunoglobulins (Not all immunoglobulins are antibodies).

- **Innate Immunity Overview:**
  - Innate immunity includes humoral and cell-mediated responses.
  - T and B cells are components of the acquired immune system.
  - B cells contribute to humoral immunity by producing immunoglobulins.

### Immunoglobulins

- **Distribution of Immunoglobulins:**
  - Found on B cell surfaces as antigen receptors.
  - Present in blood, mucous membranes, body fluids (tears, saliva, secretions of GI/GU tracts, respiratory systems).
  - Attached to Fc receptors.
  - Act as cell surface antigen receptors (anchored to cell membrane) and as secreted antibodies.

- **Identification of B Cells:**
  - Identified by surface immunoglobulins (1 x 10^5).
  - Expression of markers like B220, CD19, MHC Class II, complement receptors, and FC receptors for IgG.
  - B1 Cells also express CD5 in addition to BCR and CD19.

### Sites of B Cell Synthesis

- **Pre and Post-Birth Locations:**
  - Before birth: Yolk sac, fetal liver, fetal bone marrow.
  - After birth: Mainly in bone marrow.

- **B Cell Development Pathways:**
  - Two distinct pathways: antigen-independent and antigen-dependent.
  - Stromal cells support B cell development by providing stem cell factors and cell division molecules.
  - Sequential stages: Pro B cells → Pre B cells → Immature B cells → Mature B cells.
  - Antigen-independent phase: Leads to the generation of IgM-bearing immature B cells and IgM+IgD-bearing mature B cells.
  - Antigen-dependent phase: Triggered by antigens, leading to clonal expansion, memory cell formation, plasma cell differentiation.

### Lymphocyte Recirculation Routes

- **Lymphocyte Movement:**
  - Lymphocytes recirculate through blood and lymph to various lymphoid organs multiple times a day.
  - Percentage of lymphocytes exiting blood to different sites (spleen, lymph nodes, barrier tissues).

### Epitopes and Antibody Recognition

- **Epitopes/ Antigenic Determinants:**
  - Epitope: Specific part of an antigen recognized by antibodies, B cells, or T cells.
  - Characteristics of epitopes: Hydrophilic, surface-exposed, flexible.
  - Core epitope: 5-6 residues with surrounding residues involved in complementarity.
  - Antibody idiotope (15-22 amino acids) interacts with 15-22 amino acids of antigen.

### Diversity in Antibody Specifications

- **Immunoglobulin Gene Production:**
  - Vast diversity due to highly variable regions at the NH2 terminus and constant regions in 2/3rd of the molecule.
  - Presence of multiple isotypes with the same antigenic specificities.
  - Involvement of multiple genes in immunoglobulin chain formation.

- **Discovery of Immunoglobulin Genes:**
  - In 1976, Nobel Prize awarded for identifying which gene codes for specific parts of the antibody chain.

These topics covered the unique functions of B cells, the synthesis and distribution of immunoglobulins, B cell identification markers, stages of B cell development, lymphocyte recirculation, epitopes and antibody recognition, and the diversity of antibody specifications.
