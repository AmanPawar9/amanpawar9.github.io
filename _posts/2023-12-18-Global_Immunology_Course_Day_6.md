### How the Immune System Works: Activation of Adaptive Immunity by Innate Immunity

#### Part I: Linking Innate and Adaptive Immune Responses

- **Dendritic Cells and Antigen Presentation to T Cells:**
  - Dendritic cells engulf bacteria through phagocytosis, leading to activation.
  - Activation involves:
    i) MHC (Major Histocompatibility Complex) presentation.
    ii) Co-stimulation (e.g., CD80/CD86 on dendritic cells).
    iii) Release of cytokines.

- **Antigen Presentation Specifics:**
  - Exogenous antigens (bacteria) are presented via MHC II.
  - Endogenous antigens (viruses) are presented via MHC I.

- **Intracellular Bacteria Processing:**
  - Pathway: Bacteria in cell → Increased mRNA → MHC II synthesis → Transport to endosome containing bacteria → Acidification of endosome → MHC II binding to bacterial antigens.
  - Activated dendritic cells migrate to lymph nodes where they encounter T cells.

#### Part II: T Cell Maturation in the Thymus

- **T Cell Maturation Process:**
  - Origin: Bone Marrow → Common lymphoid progenitors → T cell precursors migrate to the Thymus.
  - Genomic rearrangement in T cells occurs in the Thymus.
  - MHC II responds to CD4, and MHC I responds to CD8.

- **Question: Genetic Manipulation of T Cell Genes in a Mouse:**
  - Answer: A mouse created with T cell genes would respond only to a specific antigen, losing the ability to combat other infections.

- **Why Genomic Expression Changes in T Cells Specifically:**
  - Answer: Altering genomic expression facilitates specific cell division processes.

#### Thymic Recognition of Self-Peptides and T Cell Selection

- **AIRE and Self-Peptide Recognition:**
  - AIRE (Autoimmune Regulator) allows thymic cells to express a wide range of self-peptides, crucial for negative selection.
  - This process occurs before functional T cell generation to avoid self-immunity.
  - Positive Selection: Promotes functional TCR.
  - Negative Selection: Eliminates high-affinity reactive T cells to prevent autoimmunity.
  - Many cells undergo apoptosis during thymic negative selection to ensure self-clearance.

- **Mechanism of T Cell Activation:**
  - Dendritic cell → MHC II presentation → T cell receptor binding → CD4 interaction with MHC class II.
  - RTKs (Receptor Tyrosine Kinases) trigger signal amplification via phosphorylation.

- **Activation Requirements for T Cell Proliferation:**
  - Need Ca++ and DAG (Diacylglycerol).
  - Phospholipase-C-gamma generates DAG and IP3.
  - CD28 signaling activates effective activation and induces CD80/86 upon activation.

These notes elaborate on the activation of adaptive immunity by the innate immune system, emphasizing dendritic cell function, antigen presentation to T cells, T cell maturation in the thymus, and mechanisms behind self-peptide recognition and T cell selection.
