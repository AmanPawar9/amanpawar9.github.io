When studying specific cells in flow or being transported:

- Develop a device to sample blood.
- Understanding individual healing processes in different individuals.

One approach to study healing variations:
- Biopsy is not preferred.
- Create a system involving blood sampling, antibody binding to specific proteins, utilizing various antibody clones for the same protein.

## Flow Cytometry
- **Microfluidics Design:** Utilizes a fluid system to narrow down cells, allowing only one cell to pass through.
- Each cell passes through a laser for analysis.
- Antibody-tagged cells get excited, emitting a signal for identification.
- Tracking cell kinetics involves injecting mice with a synthetic nucleotide (Edu) marking newly generated cells.
- Differentiates between preexisting and newly generated neutrophils.

### Basics:
- **Technology Overview:** Rapid analysis of cells or particles flowing past lasers.
- Cells analyzed for visible light scatter and fluorescence parameters.
- Multiple lasers used for various fluorophores.

#### How Does it Work:
- Measures visible light scatter in forward and side directions.
- FSC (Forward Scatter) indicates cell size.
- SSC (Side Scatter) detects granular properties (e.g., granulocytes).

- Samples prepared for fluorescent measurement via transfection and expression of fluorescent proteins (e.g., GFP).
- Differentiating live and dead cells using propidium iodide.

#### Importance of Quantifying Dead and Live Cells:
- Dead cells exhibit distinct surface marker properties compared to live cells.

## Fluidics
- Controlled fluid dynamics to allow single-cell analysis.
- Concepts of fluid dynamics applied to ensure single-cell passage.
- Varying flow rates for sensitivity adjustments and high-throughput analysis.
- High throughput aids in immunotyping without compromising sensitivity.

Challenges:
- Managing heat generation and the number of events analyzed.

## Filters
- **Long Pass Filters:** 
- **Band Pass Filters:** 

## Detectors
- **Photodiodes:** Utilized in forward scattering, requiring sufficient photons.
- **PMT (Photomultiplier Tube):** Amplifies energy received from photons, providing enhanced signal detection and calibration capabilities.

## Compensation Theory
- Addressing spillover issues arising from multiple fluorochromes used.
- Overlapping wavelength ranges make it challenging to isolate light from specific fluorochromes.

## Multicolor Panel Designing
- Factors to consider:
    - Selection of surface and intracellular markers.
    - Optimal antibody concentrations.
- Steps involved in panel designing:
    - Understand markers and study objectives.
    - Decide marker combinations and concentrations for different cell types.

Enhancing understanding through panel design:
- Identification markers (4) and activation markers (4) required.
- Combination of these markers is crucial for effective panel design.
